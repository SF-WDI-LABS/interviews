## Rainy City

**Difficulty**: Medium-Hard
**Concepts**: Looping and Arrays

You have an array of numbers representing the heights of buildings on a perfectly-packed city block.  Assuming infinite rain is available, how much rain water will collect on top of the roofs of the city block?

```

|  |      __
|  |__   |  |
|     |__|  |
|           |
[4, 2, 1, 3]
```

Test cases:
[0,1,2]
[3,2,1]
[1,0,1]
[0,1,0]
[3,2,1,3,2,0]


Note: This can be solved with only 2 passes through the array, but start with any working solution.
