Sam loves to hop up stairs. Each time she moves up stairs, she either hops up one step, or hops up two steps.  For 4 stairs, two possible paths she might take are:
* ground, to 1, to 3, to 4, or
* ground, to 2, to 4

Write a function that, given a number of stairs, calculates how many ways my neice could possibly hop up that many stairs.
